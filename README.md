### Why are we doing this? - üëç

This is being done keeping everyone in mind for being hardworking enough to contribute something meaningful even if it's something small. We are doing this to make this event fair and memorable for all.
- Right now we noticed spamming could have happened due to a lack of written guidelines, so for those who people did it, we will be allowing 200 points to gain from merging PR with official Emails and remove other scores.
- Those who do spam after publishing the guidelines, if we notice we will further level down without any notice. 

---

### Spam PRs or PRs Won't consider:
1. If you create multiple issues on documentation or workflow. Your PRs won't be considered.
2. If you know the PA or mentor. If you take advantage of it to make more PRs. Your PRs won't be considered.
3. If you completely depend on documentation or workflow or GitHub bots, Only the first 150 points will be considered. Focus on a variety of contributions.
4. Contributors, you are free to create any number of PRs in any repos excluding few repo listed below. Sticking to a particular repo will give you a strong command of the project and the tech stack. However, if we see you spamming PRs or issues, severe action will be taken against you.
